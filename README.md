We acquired this dataset from the Yelp Website which was in ‘JSON’ format. We converted these JSON files to CSV files using Python code. We did a complete analysis only on food service businesses in USA. We wanted to help a particular client to open up a new restaurant in US and hence we decided to answer ‘WHERE’, ‘WHAT’, ‘HOW’ and ‘WHO’ questions based on our analysis. This would give the client a clear idea about their new venture.
Our analysis included the below points:
•	‘WHERE’ – We used Kmeans clustering to find the patterns in location that has the highest rating among the users. This was done using R Studio and the results showed ‘Las Vegas’ is the place.
•	‘WHAT’ – We focused on what categories of restaurants do better than the others and the resulting category “Buffet” were most popular.
•	‘HOW’ – We compared different factors that a restaurant in different price ranges need to be successful. We focused on Ambience, Alcohol, Wi-Fi, and Buffet. The resulting visualizations aligned with the regression results.
•	‘WHO’ – We wanted to determine who would be best reviewers which would a create a buzz around the restaurant. Again we did a regression analysis on the reviewers and listed top 10 reviewers.

We concluded our analysis by stating that the above key indicators would be very useful in opening a new restaurant and would recommend the client to keep a close eye on those.
